                    <h3>Hey there, I'm Gerson! üëãüèΩ</h3>
                    <p>I started my career as a graphic designer when I was a teenager, soon after I started working
                        with
                        games and fell in love with product development, especially digital ones. Projects that require
                        a
                        high degree of vision, problem solving, knowledge of needs and visual polish are what drives me.
                        In
                        my design experience, I've found that bringing the user to the center of the process and
                        collaborating closely with working partners and stakeholders during all phases results in a
                        better
                        product. I'm constantly looking for innovative ideas to deliver the best in terms of user
                        interaction and experience. I also take the opportunity to be involved in different projects to
                        learn, research and present ideas outside the box. I am a designer who loves to learn new skills
                        and
                        techniques daily in search of continuous evolution.</p>
